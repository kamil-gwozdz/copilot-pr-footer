Show the pull requests, issues, and gists your **GitHub Copilot CLI** session
**created** or **updated** — with live **CI / review / merge** state — right in
Copilot's status-line footer.

Examples:

1. Screenshoot

2. More complex example
```
⎇ +reposd#2488 merged  +rails#1340 ci✓ appr  ~ruby#50669 ci…
```

- `+` (green) = the session **created** it · `~` (blue) = the session **updated** it
- State badges: `draft` · `ci…` running · `ci✓` passed · `ci✗` failed · `rev?` review
  required · `appr` approved · `chg` changes requested · `merged` · `closed`
- Links are clickable (OSC 8)

It reads the session's own event log to tell **what the agent actually did** from
URLs you merely pasted or referenced, and never blocks the footer on the network
(PR state is cached and refreshed in the background).

## Install

```sh
npm install -g copilot-pr-footer
copilot-pr-footer install
```

Then open a new Copilot CLI session. That's it.

`install` sets `statusLine` and `footer.showCustom` in `~/.copilot/settings.json`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 16**
- **[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`)**, authenticated (`gh auth login`),
  for the PR-state badges. Without it, the footer still lists created/updated
  artifacts and shows a one-line hint (suppressible — see below).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `copilot-pr-footer install` | Wire it into `~/.copilot/settings.json` |
| `copilot-pr-footer uninstall` | Remove it from `settings.json` |
| `copilot-pr-footer doctor` | Show status (node, gh, settings) |
| `copilot-pr-footer disable-gh-warning` | Hide the “gh not installed/authorized” line |
| `copilot-pr-footer enable-gh-warning` | Show it again |

## Configuration (env vars)

- `CX_FOOTER_STATE=0` — disable live PR-state badges (just list artifacts)
- `CX_FOOTER_HINT=0` — hide the dim “no artifacts yet” placeholder
- `CX_FOOTER_WIDTH=<n>` — pin the column budget (overrides auto-detect); `0` disables
  truncation entirely

## Fitting the terminal width

The footer keeps itself within the terminal width so it never gets chopped
mid-label or mid-hyperlink. The status-line payload carries no width, so the width
is auto-detected from the controlling TTY; when a session touches more artifacts
than fit, the trailing ones collapse into a single dim `+N` counter at a clean
boundary. If auto-detect ever misses (or you want a fixed budget), set
`CX_FOOTER_WIDTH` or a `width` number in `~/.copilot/copilot-pr-footer/config.json`.

## How it works

Copilot CLI's custom status line runs a command every few seconds and passes a
JSON payload on stdin that includes `session_id` and `transcript_path`. This tool:

1. Reads `<transcript_path>/events.jsonl` and detects artifact mutations from three
   kinds of events:
   - **Shell `gh` commands** — joins each tool's `execution_start` (the command) with
     its `execution_complete` (the output) by tool-call id.
   - **MCP-server / extension tools** — `external_tool.requested` calls (e.g. the
     [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)). These are
     classified by tool name and resolved from the call's structured arguments
     (`{owner/repo, number}`) or an explicit url field.
   - **Remote shell-exec tools** — tools that run a command elsewhere (e.g. in a
     codespace) are treated like a local `gh` command.
2. Counts a URL only when it was a real **create** (`gh pr/issue/gist create`, or a
   `create_*` tool → created) or a **mutation** (`gh pr/issue …` edit/comment/review/
   merge/ready/close/…, or an `update_*`/`merge_*`/`add_*_comment` tool → updated).
   Read-only tools (`get_*`, `list_*`, `wait_*`, …) and heredoc bodies that merely
   mention `gh pr create` are ignored, so neither causes a false positive.
3. Resolves live PR state for **all** PRs in a single batched `gh api graphql` call
   (state, draft, review decision, and CI rollup), cached at
   `~/.copilot/copilot-pr-footer/pr-cache.json` and refreshed by a **detached**
   background process so the footer stays instant.

The official GitHub MCP server tools are recognized out of the box. Any unknown tool
is still classified by a generic verb in its name, so most tools work with no setup.

Works for every session that has an event log (present since the first Copilot CLI
sessions). Nothing is sent anywhere; all reads are local and read-only.

### Registering your own tools

If you use a private MCP server or Copilot CLI extension whose tool names this tool
doesn't recognize, register them in `~/.copilot/copilot-pr-footer/config.json` under
`externalTools` — a map of tool name to `created`, `updated`, or `ignore` (to silence
a noisy default). This stays on your machine; nothing is baked into the package.

```json
{
  "externalTools": {
    "my_pr_body_updater": "updated",
    "my_thing_creator": "created",
    "some_noisy_tool": "ignore"
  }
}
```

The tool must pass `{owner/repo, number}` (or a gist id, or a url field) in its
arguments — or the artifact url in its result — for the link to resolve.

Unknown tools are classified by a generic verb in their name (the **heuristic**),
which is on by default. To rely solely on the built-in GitHub MCP defaults plus the
tools you register above, turn it off:

```json
{ "heuristic": false }
```

## Uninstall

```sh
copilot-pr-footer uninstall
npm uninstall -g copilot-pr-footer
```

## Releasing (maintainers)

Releases follow the npm convention of **semver tags `vX.Y.Z`**. Pushing such a tag
triggers the `publish` workflow, which lints, tests, verifies the tag matches
`package.json`, and runs `npm publish`.

```sh
npm version patch     # or minor / major — bumps package.json and creates the vX.Y.Z tag
git push --follow-tags
```

Publishing uses npm [**Trusted Publishing**](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/)
(OIDC) — **no `NPM_TOKEN` secret**. Short-lived credentials are minted per run from the
workflow's OIDC identity (`id-token: write`), and provenance is generated automatically.

One-time setup on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com): *Package → Settings → Trusted
Publisher → GitHub Actions*, then enter:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Organization or user | `kamil-gwozdz` |
| Repository | `copilot-pr-footer` |
| Workflow filename | `publish.yml` |

Fields are case-sensitive and must match exactly (including the `.yml` extension).
